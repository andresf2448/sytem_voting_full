# sytem_voting_full
A voting system is implemented on blockchain using solidity as technology for the development of smart contracts, react and ethers for the graphical interface and MetaMask as a provider for the communication of the JSON-RPC protocol. 

In order to sign the operations (transactions) it is necessary to have the wallet linked to our provider.

Within the platform users can:
* Apply to become a candidate, entering their photo and required information.
* Vote for a candidate.
* Consult the number of votes for a candidate.
* See the winner of the votes.

Additionally, there is an admin who is in charge of opening the votes, closing them and generating the winner.

Some of the operations that the user performs within the platform require signature through the metaMask provider since they are procedures that directly affect the blockchain.
